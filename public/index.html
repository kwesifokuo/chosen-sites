                I am interested in becoming a Full-Stack Developer at Tailwind UI because I just discovered Tailwind CSS and I love it already. I am a self-taught programmer from a Finance and Accounting background. I stumbled upon coding in 2011.

                I am currently the Lead Developer with my Software Startup in Accra, Ghana in West Africa. About a year ago, I was employed as a Software Engineer at CDH Investment Holdings Ltd in Accra. At CDH, I developed mobile apps for Android and iOS using the Ionic hybrid mobile app development framework, Investment web application software and websites for our subsidiaries as well as help maintain them.

                I code mostly in PHP using the Laravel Framework and Laravel Voyager for my Admin Dashboard, but I am familiar with Python and Ruby. For User Interface and Experience, I use vanilla JavaScript and its libraries and Frameworks like Angular, TypeScript, jQuery, etc. I work with Docker to setup ready Apache or Nginx servers with PHP and databases. I am quite conversant with the Linux Operating System command line and mostly do a lot of work on remote cloud servers on Digital Ocean.

                I have been working on websites and web applications for the past 7 years and learning so much every day to get better. I am a fast learner and a tech-enthusiast. I have recently developed an interest in AI and Data Science and exploring.

                I have enclosed my resume. I look forward to meeting with you and discussing my qualifications in more detail.
